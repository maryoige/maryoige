<p><h3><span style="color:blue;font-weight:light"><u>The Plot</u></span></h3>
The movie is set in the mythic pre-historic times. A young hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a ring from his elderly cousin Bilbo Baggins.
Wise to the powers that the ring holds, the dark Lord Sauron wants it, knowing it will enable him to enslave the people of the middle earth.
In his efforts to thwart Sauron, Frodo recruits the fellowship of a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, a king and his hobbit friends on a mission to 
destroy the ring, by casting it into the volcanic fires of the crack of doom.
